This is the beginning of a new era. The human species is experiencing a new time of
exploration, we are now probing the next frontier and probably the last, space.
Governements do not yet have either the will or thechnology to expand their influence
over large clusters of star, nevermind galaxy. This leave the most adventurous of us
free to go where ever we wish and make a name for ourselves. The only way for us to
roam the universe is by using a technology that warp space itself. Everybody call it
space jump, even if as you know it is not accurate. This is however where our name
comes from.

We are space jumpers.

As you would expect, making a living out there is a risky buisness, we need to scavenge
to survive, food, water and such... Obviously doing so we damage our ships, which
means that we also need to find the resources to mend it, and actually proceed with
the reperations whatever the environment.

All this I am sure beg the question why did choose we this way of life? And as always
the answer is: "The journey is well worth it!".

Contrarily to most science fiction movies of the 21st century we choose not to produce
an artificial gravity on our space craft. The technology exists though. In fact most
commercial ship are equipped with it. Most customers do not feel comfortable living in
a 0G environment. We on the other hand find it extremely practical. In particular not having
a concept of up and down means that every surface can be used as storage without risking
something falling on your head. What's more is that not having it means not having to repair
it when it breaks, we tend to be economical with the tech we use for that reason.

This choice has a significant downside, without proper exercise the muscles get weak
which would make it impossible to explore a planet without first accomodating to the
gravity. In order to cope with that issue we are constantly wearing exoskeletons that
reproduce the stress gravity would have on our muscles and bones. It is possible to adjust
the forces so that if we plan on landing on a planet with higher gravity that what we are
used to we are able to prepare for it. Alternatively, these exosqueletons can help us
compensate for a gravity we wouldn't be able to adjust too.

Very few other people wear this sort of exoskeleton and all of us do.

Not having gravity aboard the ship means that our food has to be sealed in containers to
prevent it from flying away. For the same reason we can't eat any crispy food, any crumbs
would rapidly become unmanageable obstructing the vents and ending up in people eyes.
The room in which we eat altogether is round and its ceiling is transparent so that
we can contemplate the void as we share a meal. On the side perpendicular to the window
wall there are straps we can use when we eat and on the wall opposite to the window multiple
handles and drawers to move around and store the food.

For survival reasons and because it involves space travel, space jumpers need
to be highly educated and excel in their field. At some point everyone expertise
means life or death for the entire crew.

The old saying goes: "In space, there is no situation so bad you can't make it worse."
